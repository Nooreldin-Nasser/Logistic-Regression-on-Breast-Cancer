# Logistic-Regression-on-Breast-Cancer
In this project We will be working with the Breast Cancer dataset, which contains some very detailed measurements of cells. Along with each observation of measurements, we have the diagnosis of the cell (malignant or not). Our goal is to train a model that will be able to predict whether or not a given cell is malignant given only its measurements.
We are going to build our model from scratch.
